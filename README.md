# Sean McCaffery Estate Planning
## The Last Will and Testament of Sean Michael McCaffery
This document should only be opened or accessed in the case of my death. In the SeanMichaelMcCafferyLastWillAndTestament folder, there is a folder called SMMWillVault, which is a [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/) vault. In order to open this vault, you need to download [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/) and follow the instructions on opening a vault with it. When you get to the point where you need a password, you can get said password from [www.theuswillregistry.org](www.theuswillregistry.org) by searching for me by [searching for a missing Will](https://www.theuswillregistry.org/missing-will-search-request) and submitting the relevant information for them to release the location of my will and this password. You must be either my partner, an immediate family member of mine, have my Power of Attorney, or be an executor of mine to do this (as these are the only people who are permissioned to request this information on www.theuswillregistry.org).
